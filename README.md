# odin-landing-page

In this project, I'm going to design a basic webpage with my knowledge of basic HTML 
and CSS (uptil flexbox). I'm going to type in any difficulties i faced and how i 
solved them in this README.md file.

1. I am stuck in formatting the style for the hero-text, I am not able to get the main heading and the content and the sign-up button in the same column and push the image to the side of the page.
